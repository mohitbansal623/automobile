"An electro-luminescent panel causes the entire face to glow for easy reading. Auto Light automatically turns on the EL backlight when the watch is tilted towards your face for reading. A luminous coating provides long-term illumination in the dark after only a short exposure to light. A sensor measures the ambient temperature around the watch and displays it in °C (-10°C /+60°C). Displays the current time in major cities and specific areas around the world. Elapsed time, split time and final time are measured with 1/100-sec accuracy. The watch can measure times of up to 100 hours. Measured total, lap and split times can be stored in a memory with the date and can be displayed again later. A data set consists of: date, total, lap and split times. The memory has enough space for up to 50 data sets. Some models can also store calculated distances and calories. For fans of precision: the countdown timers help you to remember specific or recurring events by giving off an audible signal at a preset time. They then count back automatically from the preset time. The time can be set to the minute and up to 100 hours in advance. Ideal for people who need to take medicines every day or those who do interval training. The daily alarm reminds you of events that recur every day, by emitting an audible signal at the set time. The button tones for using the mode button can be turned off. This means that the watch no longer beeps when switching from one function to another. Preset alarm or countdown timers remain active when the button tones are deactivated.
Once set, the automatic calendar always displays the correct date.
Times can be displayed in either a 12-hour or 24-hour format.
The tough, scratch-resistant mineral glass protects the watch against unsightly damage.
The surface of the watch glass is domed. This offers a high level of stability and resistance against pressure.

Always reliable: This watch has a particularly secure safety catch, which helps prevent the strap from opening by mistake. 
The battery supplies the watch with sufficient energy for approx. three years.
Perfect for swimming and snorkelling: the watch is water resistant to 10 bar / 100 metres. The metres value does not relate to a diving depth but to the air pressure used in the course of the water resistance test. (ISO 22810).
